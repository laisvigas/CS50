-- The Massachusetts Legislature would like to learn how much money,
-- on average, districts spent per-pupil last year.
-- In 3.sql, write a SQL query to find the average per-pupil expenditure.
-- Name the column “Average District Per-Pupil Expenditure”.
-- Note the per_pupil_expenditure column in the expenditures table contains the average amount,
-- per pupil, each district spent last year. You’ve been asked to find the average of this set of averages,
-- weighting all districts equally regardless of their size.

SELECT AVG(per_pupil_expenditure) AS [Average District Per-Pupil Expenditure]
FROM expenditures;
