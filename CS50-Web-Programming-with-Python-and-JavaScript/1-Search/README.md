# Assignment 0 - SEARCH

## Specifications

- The website should have at least three pages: one for regular Google Search (which must be called index.html), one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.

- On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.

- On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.

- Like Google’s own, the search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered, and should be beneath the search bar.
  
- On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

- On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options):
    * Find pages with… “all these words:”
    * Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
    * Find pages with… “any of these words:”
    * Find pages with… “none of these words:”

- Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.

- Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text.

- When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to the search results page for their given query.

- Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page.
